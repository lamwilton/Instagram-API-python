Unofficial Instagram API to give you access to ALL Instagram features (like, follow, upload photo and video, etc)! Written in Python.

This is the Python port of https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API which is written in PHP.
It is still a work in progress to copy all of its API endpoints.

NOTE: To successfully parse for a long time you should verify your phone number in your Instagram account. 
The new fake Instagram account with an unverified phone number after ~ 1-24 hours could not do any requests. All requests will be redirected to the page https://instagram.com/challenge
